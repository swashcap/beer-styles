# [Beer Styles](http://swashcap.github.io/beer-styles/)

_A beer-y style guide._

This style guide relies on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to build the site. Make sure you have it installed and run `jekyll serve` to build the project and run it on a local server. Then, visit `localhost:4000/beer-styles/` to see it.
